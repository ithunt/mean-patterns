## MEAN Patterns
Utilizing the MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS) stack to rapidly create web applications

    cd mean-patterns
    npm start
    http://localhost:3000

## Purpose
With the introduction of Node.js it is now possible to create full stack web applications in a single language, Javascript. Leaving aside the debates about Javascript itself, this confers enormous benefits for programmer productivity. Task Switching is a cognitively expensive task for us humans. After getting excited about a new feature I coded in my Java backend, I've found my excitement quickly dissipates as I drop one mental model and its associated muscle memory for another.

Still looking for hard science related to programming but cognitive task switching is well studied in psychology.

## Code
Using [JSLint](http://jslint.com) from Doug Crockford to improve code quality

Note the extensive use of `"use strict";` statements in functions in `index.js`
